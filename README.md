# Submission for the Solver AI Technical Assessment

### Introduction

This repository contains my submission for the technical assessment from Solver AI. I found it to be an engaging challenge and approached the three tasks by building them out as end-to-end, deployed web applications. My attempt at the requirements resulted in a RAG-powered AI avatar coach with a cloud CRM; a meta-agent that generates automation workflows from natural language; and an emotionally-aware product recommender that uses vector search. Throughout these projects, I prioritized the recommended cost-efficient stack, utilizing tools like Streamlit, DeepSeek, Pinecone, and Turso. The live demos and detailed documentation for each task are linked in the showcase below.
